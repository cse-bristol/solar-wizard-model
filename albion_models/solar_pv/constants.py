# A roof is considered to be flat if it's slope is less than this. Not to be confused
# with the model parameter `flat_roof_degrees`, which is the slope at which panels
# are mounted on flat roofs.
FLAT_ROOF_DEGREES_THRESHOLD = 5.0

# If a roof plane has an aspect which is closer than this value to the azimuth of
# one of the facings of a building, re-align the roof plane to that azimuth.
AZIMUTH_ALIGNMENT_THRESHOLD = 15

# Same as above, but for flat roofs:
FLAT_ROOF_AZIMUTH_ALIGNMENT_THRESHOLD = 45

# PVGIS recommend this factor is applied to cover losses due to cabling, inverter, and
# degradation due to age.
