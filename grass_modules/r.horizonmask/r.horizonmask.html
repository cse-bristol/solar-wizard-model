<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<b>r.horizonmask</b>

<p>
    This is a modified version of r.horizon that takes a mask raster which tells it which pixels not to build a horizon
    profile for. This is different from the interaction of r.horizon with r.mask, as r.mask also stops masked pixels
    from being treated as blocking the horizon for other, non-masked, pixels.
